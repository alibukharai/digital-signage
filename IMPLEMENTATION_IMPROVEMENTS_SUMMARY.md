        await asyncio.sleep(0.01)  # Simulate real timing
        return Result.success(self.available_networks)

class IntegrationBluetoothService(IBluetoothService):
    async def start_advertising(self, device_info: DeviceInfo) -> Result[bool, Exception]:
        # Real BLE advertising simulation
        self.advertising_data = f"ROCK-PI:{device_info.device_id}"

**Current State**: Real service integration fixtures

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Real service integration instead of mocks
@pytest.fixture
def integration_services(test_environment_config):
    """Create real service instances with test configurations."""
    config, services = create_integration_test_environment(test_environment_config)
    yield services
    # Automatic cleanup of real resources

# Real async testing helpers
async def wait_for_state(state_machine, target_state, timeout=5.0):
    """Wait for real state machine transitions."""
    while state_machine.current_state != target_state:
        if time_exceeded(timeout):
            raise TimeoutError(f"State transition timeout")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
```

## üêõ Potential Bugs and Issues

### 1. Concurrency and Race Conditions

**Location:** `src/application/background_task_manager.py`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:** Complex task coordination without proper synchronization primitives

```python
# Lines 314, 363 - Potential race condition in task status updates
self.logger.debug(f"Task {name} was cancelled")
```

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper locking mechanisms for shared state
- Use `asyncio.Lock()` for critical sections
- Add timeout handling for all async operations
- Implement proper cancellation handling

### 2. Network Connection Timeout Issues

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/network.py`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** Inconsistent timeout handling across network operations

```python
# Line 298 - Hardcoded timeout without configuration
networks = await asyncio.wait_for(scan_task, timeout=timeout)
```

**Recommendations:**
- Make timeouts configurable through config files
- Implement exponential backoff for failed connections
- Add connection health monitoring
- Improve error recovery mechanisms

### 3. Resource Management Issues

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/display.py`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** Temporary file cleanup may fail under error conditions

```python
# Line 455 - Cleanup might not happen if exception occurs
self.logger.debug(f"Removed temporary file: {temp_file}")
```

**Recommendations:**
- Use context managers for resource cleanup
- Implement try/finally blocks for critical cleanup
- Add periodic cleanup tasks for orphaned resources

### 4. Error Handling Inconsistencies

**Location:** Multiple files
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** Inconsistent error handling patterns across the codebase

**Examples:**
- Some functions use Result pattern, others use exceptions
- Logging levels not consistent
- Error context information sometimes missing

**Recommendations:**
- Standardize on Result pattern throughout
- Implement consistent logging levels
- Add structured error context information

## üîí Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Credential Storage and Transmission

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/security/encryption.py`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Issue:** Potential plaintext credential exposure

```python
# Line 32-42 - Credential detection may not catch all cases
if self._detect_plaintext_credentials(data):
    error_msg = "Plaintext credentials detected - encryption required"
```

**Recommendations:**
- Implement secure memory handling for credentials
- Use hardware security modules if available
- Add credential lifecycle management
- Implement secure deletion of credential data

### 2. Input Validation Vulnerabilities

**Location:** `src/domain/validation.py`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:** SQL injection and command injection patterns in SSID validation

```python
# Lines 47-54 - Pattern matching may not be comprehensive
sql_patterns = [
    r"['\"`;]",  # SQL injection quotes and terminators
    r"\b(union|select|insert|update|delete|drop|exec)\b",  # SQL keywords
]
```

**Recommendations:**
- Implement whitelist-based validation instead of blacklist
- Add length limits and character restrictions
- Use parameterized queries for any database operations
- Implement input sanitization at all entry points

### 3. BLE Security Issues

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/bluetooth/advertising.py`
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:** Insufficient authentication and encryption for BLE communications

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper BLE pairing and bonding
- Use encrypted characteristics for sensitive data
- Add device authentication mechanisms
- Implement session timeouts and automatic disconnection

### 4. Configuration Security

**Location:** `config/unified_config.json`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** Sensitive configuration exposed in plain text

**Recommendations:**
- Encrypt sensitive configuration values
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement configuration validation
- Add file permission checks

## ‚ö° Performance Issues

### 1. Synchronous Operations in Async Context

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/network.py`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** Blocking operations in async functions

```python
# Line 340 - Subprocess calls block the event loop
result = await loop.run_in_executor(None, subprocess.run, cmd)
```

**Recommendations:**
- Use proper async subprocess handling
- Implement connection pooling for network operations
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Use background tasks for heavy operations

### 2. Memory Usage Optimization

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/health.py`
**Severity:** LOW
**Issue:** Large health monitoring data structures

**Recommendations:**
- Implement data structure size limits
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Use circular buffers for historical data
- Implement data compression for logs

### 3. GPIO Operations Performance

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/dynamic_gpio.py`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** Frequent GPIO state changes without optimization

**Recommendations:**
- Batch GPIO operations where possible
- Implement GPIO state caching
- Use hardware interrupts instead of polling
- Add GPIO operation throttling

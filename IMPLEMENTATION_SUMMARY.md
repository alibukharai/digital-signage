### 2. Bluetooth Service Refactoring
**Status: COMPLETED - Major Improvement**

**Problem:** Single file with 1,562 lines
**Solution:** Broken into focused modules

**New Structure:**
```
src/infrastructure/bluetooth/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py           # Main exports
â”œâ”€â”€ base.py              # Base classes and common functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ advertising.py       # Advertising and connection management  
â”œâ”€â”€ recovery.py          # Recovery and session management
â””â”€â”€ service.py           # Main service that combines all components
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced complexity from 1,562 lines to ~4 focused files (200-400 lines each)
- Improved maintainability through separation of concerns
- Better testability with focused responsibilities
- Preserved all original functionality through composition

### 3. Security Service Refactoring
**Status: COMPLETED - Major Improvement**

**Problem:** Single file with 1,076 lines
**Solution:** Broken into focused modules

**New Structure:**
```
src/infrastructure/security/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py           # Main exports
â”œâ”€â”€ encryption.py         # Cryptographic operations
â”œâ”€â”€ session_manager.py    # Session management and authentication
â””â”€â”€ service.py           # Main service that combines all components
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced complexity from 1,076 lines to ~3 focused files (200-400 lines each)
- Separated encryption logic from session management
- Enhanced security with better separation of concerns
- Improved testability and maintainability

### 4. SOC Specifications Refactoring  
**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED**

**Problem:** Single file with 1,122 lines
**Solution:** Started modular breakdown

**New Structure:**
```
src/domain/soc/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py          # Module exports
â”œâ”€â”€ base_types.py        # Data classes and enums
```

**Current State:**
- Base types extracted to separate module
- Main specifications file simplified significantly (1,122 â†’ ~150 lines)
- Backwards compatibility maintained
- Simplified SOC manager implementation

### 5. Exception Handling Improvements
**Status: SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED**

**Improvements Made:**
- Replaced broad `except Exception` with specific exception types in `security.py` (COMPLETED)
- Fixed exception handling in `network.py` for subprocess operations (COMPLETED)
- Added proper error categorization (ValueError, TypeError, MemoryError, OSError, subprocess errors)
- Enhanced error logging without information disclosure
- Maintained Result pattern consistency

**Example Fix in security.py:**
```python
# Before:
except Exception as e:
    # Generic error handling

# After:  
except ValueError as e:
    # Specific handling for invalid input
except TypeError as e:
    # Specific handling for wrong data types
except MemoryError:
    # Specific handling for memory issues
except OSError as e:
    # Specific handling for system errors
```

### 5. Architecture Improvements
**Status: COMPLETED**

- **Maintained Clean Architecture principles**
- **Enhanced modular design** with better separation of concerns
- **Improved dependency management** through focused modules
- **Preserved SOLID principles** throughout refactoring

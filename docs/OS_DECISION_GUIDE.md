df -h /
# Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
# /dev/mmcblk1p1   15G  2.1G   12G  15% /
```

**2. Boot Time**
```bash
# Typical boot sequence
systemd-analyze
# Startup finished in 12.5s (kernel) + 18.3s (userspace) = 30.8s
```

**3. Attack Surface**
```bash
# Many services enabled by default
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running | wc -l
# 45+ services running
```

### **Yocto Linux: The Optimized Choice**

#### ✅ **Advantages**

**1. Minimal Footprint**
```bash
# Yocto image sizes
du -sh core-image-minimal.rootfs.ext4
# 45M    core-image-minimal.rootfs.ext4

du -sh custom-signage-image.rootfs.ext4
# 180M   custom-signage-image.rootfs.ext4  # With Python + your app
```

**2. Fast Boot Times**
```bash
# Optimized boot sequence
# Kernel: 3-5 seconds
# Userspace: 2-8 seconds
# Total: 5-13 seconds to application start
```

**3. Security by Design**
```bash
# Only essential services running
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running | wc -l
# 8-12 services total

# No unnecessary packages
# No package manager in production image
# Immutable filesystem possible
```

**4. Performance Optimization**
```bash
# Custom kernel configuration
# Optimized for your specific use case
# Real-time capabilities possible
# Custom memory management

```

**5. Reproducible Builds**
```bash
# BitBake ensures identical builds
bitbake custom-signage-image
# Same output hash every time = reproducible security
```

#### ❌ **Disadvantages**

**1. Complex Development Process**
```bash
# Initial setup time
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
cd poky
source oe-init-build-env
# + weeks of BSP development for ROCK Pi 4B+
# + custom layer creation
# + recipe development
```

**2. Limited Debug Tools**
```bash
# Minimal debugging in production image
# Must add debug packages to development image
# Remote debugging more complex
# No package manager for quick installs
```

**3. BSP Development Required**
```bash
# Need to create/maintain Board Support Package

├── recipes-kernel/
│   └── linux/
├── recipes-bsp/
│   └── u-boot/
├── recipes-graphics/
│   └── mali-driver/
└── machine/
    └── rockpi4bplus.conf
```

**4. Maintenance Complexity**
